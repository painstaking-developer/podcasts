# Recovery Podcast Listings

### About this project

This website hosts RSS podcast feeds that may be used to listen to groups of recordings on various podcast players. Instructions on how to use the RSS URL links below can be found [here](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041347732--How-to-use-your-custom-audio-RSS-link#h_01GFM5VYVBGNB1WQF47PEQBB1A). Personally, I recommend Pocket Casts.

The motivation behind this project is to make groupings of recordings available as podcasts so that listeners may benefit from the convenience of using a podcast player. 

### New episodes and podcasts
If you would like a podcast to be updated with the latest episodes or want a new group of recordings to be made into a podcast, it would be a pleasure to help. Please email me at [painstaking.developer@gmail.com](mailto:painstaking.developer@gmail.com).  

### Support
